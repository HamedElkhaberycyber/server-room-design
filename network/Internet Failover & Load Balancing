# Internet Failover & Load Balancing Design

## WAN Architecture
- 7× ADSL internet connections
- All WAN links terminate on MikroTik router

## Router Role
- Load balancing across multiple ISPs
- Automatic failover
- Traffic prioritization

## Load Balancing Method
- PCC (Per Connection Classifier)
- Even distribution of outbound sessions

## Failover Behavior
- Link monitoring via gateway ping
- Automatic route removal on link failure
- Seamless traffic rerouting

## Traffic Control
- Critical services prioritized (Servers, VPN)
- Guest Wi-Fi limited bandwidth
- Per-user bandwidth control applied
