## Cooling Objectives
- Maintain temperature: 18–24°C
- Prevent hotspots
- Ensure equipment longevity

## Room Cooling Design

### 1. Air Conditioning
- 1 Split AC units (Inverter preferred)
- Capacity: 18,000–24,000 BTU each

  

### 2. Airflow Strategy
- Cold air intake from front of rack
- Hot air exhaust from rear
- AC airflow directed toward rack front

### 3. Rack Airflow Management
- Use blanking panels
- Seal unused rack spaces
- Keep rear clearance ≥ 60 cm

### 4. Environmental Monitoring
- Temperature sensor
- Humidity control (40–60%)
- Optional SNMP monitoring

### 5. Emergency Measures
- AC failure alert
- Automatic server shutdown if temp exceeds threshold
