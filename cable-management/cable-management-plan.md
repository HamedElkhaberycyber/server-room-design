## Cable Management Strategy

### Horizontal Management
- 1U cable managers between devices

### Vertical Management
- Route cables along rack sides

### Cable Color Coding
- White: LAN
- Blue: Servers
- Yellow: Uplinks
- Red/Orange: WAN

### Labeling
- Label both ends of each cable
- Example: SW1-Gi0/5 → Server1-NIC1
